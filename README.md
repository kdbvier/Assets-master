# Trust Wallet Assets Info

![Check](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## Overview
Trust Wallet token repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.

[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects.

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.

## How to add token

Please note that __brand new tokens are not accepted__,
the projects have to be sound, with information available, and __non-minimal circulation__
(for limit details see https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-submit-a-token-logo/3863).

### Assets App

The [Assets web app](https://assets.trustwallet.com) can be used for most new token additions (Github account is needed).

### Quick starter

Details of the repository structure and contribution guidelines are listed on the
[Developers site](https://developer.trustwallet.com/add_new_asset).
Here is a quick starter summary for the most common use case.

**Adding an ERC20 token checklist**:
- [ ] Make sure your smartcontract has more than 2,500 address holders, otherwise you will be rejected
- [ ] Fork the Github repository
- [ ] Create folder with name of token smartcontact address in [_checksum format_](https://developer.trustwallet.com/add_new_asset#checksum_format) `blockchains/ethereum/assets/<token_smartcontract_address>/`.
- [ ] Tell your designer that token image must be in PNG format, avoid transparent background, recommended size 256x256px, max. 512x512px, with max file size of 100kB, for further details read [image rules](https://developer.trustwallet.com/add_new_asset#image-requirements).
- [ ] Upload your logo with file named `logo.png` to previously created folder with smartcontract address, and if you done all correctly your path should look like this. `blockchains/ethereum/assets/0x1234567461d3f8Db7496581774Bd869C83D51c93/logo.png`
- [ ] Create `info.json` file with info about the token/project
- [ ] Create a pull request to the main repo
- [ ] Pay the processing fee

## Scripts

There are several scripts available for maintainers:

- `npm run check` -- Execute validation checks; also used in continuous integration.
- `npm run check-sanity` -- Strict subset of checks
- `npm run fix` -- Perform automatic fixes where possible
- `npm run fix-sanity` -- Stricter subset
- `npm run updateAuto` -- Run automatic updates from external sources, executed regularly (GitHub action)
- `npm run update` -- Run manual updates from external sources, for manual use.
- `npm test` -- Run script unit tests
- `npm lint` -- Run Lint static code check

## On Checks

This repo contais a set of scripts for verification of all the information.  Implemented as Typescript scripts, available through `npm run check`, and executed in CI build; checks the whole repo.
There are similar check logic implemeted:
- in assets-management app; for checking changed token files in PRs, or when creating a PR.  Implemented as a Typescript library, checks diffs, can be run from browser environment.
- in merge-fee-bot, which runs as a GitHub app shows result in PR comment.  Also uses library, but executes in a non-browser environment.

## Trading pair maintenance

Info on supported trading pairs are stored in `tokenlist.json` files.
Trading pairs can be updated --
from Uniswap/Ethereum and PancakeSwap/Smartchain -- using update script (and checking in changes).
Minimal limit values for trading pair inclusion are set in the `config.ts` file.
There are also options for force-include and force-exclude in the config.
